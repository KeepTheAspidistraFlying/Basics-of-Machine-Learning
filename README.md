# Basics-of-Machine-Learning
very basic but essential info on ML

Hey Guyz;

i am going to update this file with new info everytime i find something interesting, so it might get more detailed.
if u have any question or suggestion, plz contact me via my email; Hajiahmadiparisa@yahoo.com

consider these 2 types of learning;

1] supervised learning: known target based on past data

2] unsupervised learning: no known past answer

now, another type of categorizing;

a] classification: what class something belongs to

b] regression: predicting a numerical value

***************************************************************************************************************************

every algorithm is specified for a type of learning. 

for instance; "Logestic Regression", it is used for classification problems. (dont mix the name of the algorithm with its type of problem.) I used this algorithm in Titanic Survival Prediction, Breast Cancer Prediction & Bob the Builder. u can find these projects in my repos by the same name.

***************************************************************************************************************************

u can use different programming languages for implementation of these algorithms but I prefer Python.
I find Python packages very useful; 

Pandas; reading big data & data manipulation

numpy; computation of numerical data/ manipulating lists & tables of numerical data

matplotlib; graphing data

scikit-learn; machine learning models (one of the best documented Python modules)

***************************************************************************************************************************

there are 2 commonly metrics for classification; Precision and Recall

Precision; TP/(TP+FP)

Recall; TP/(TP+FN)

TP:True Positive/// FP:False Positive/// FN:False Negative/// TN:True Negative

the values of Precision & Recall that we are aiming for depends on the dataset and the application.
